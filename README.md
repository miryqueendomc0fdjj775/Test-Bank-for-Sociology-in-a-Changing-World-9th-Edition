Authors: William Kornblum, David W Martin, Kornblum
Help your students visualize sociology all around them with William Kornblum's vibrant, visual, and research-based new ninth edition of SOCIOLOGY IN A CHANGING WORLD. Comprehensive and student friendly, SOCIOLOGY IN A CHANGING WORLD presents a thematic approach that emphasizes the reality of social change and its impact on individuals, groups, and societies throughout the world. This unique emphasis on social change--which is visited in the book's features--helps students understand our similarities, our differences, and society as a whole. The text carefully balances contemporary and classic theory and research, with special attention to the works of female and minority social scientists and cross-cultural studies. Kornblum applies all the major perspectives of sociology without giving undue emphasis to any single approach. Additionally, SOCIOLOGY IN A CHANGING WORLD is the chosen text for the Exploring Society: Introduction to Sociology Telecourse from Dallas TeleLearning. Challenging yet accessible, interesting and scholarly, Kornblum's ninth edition helps students think like sociologists long after their college experience.
